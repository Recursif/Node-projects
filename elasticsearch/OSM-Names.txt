# OSM Names 

Database of geographic place names with hierarchy and bounding 
boxes from OpenStreetMap for full text search downloadable

OSMNames project offers downloadable list of place names derived from OpenStreetMap database with a easy installation, clear licensing and clear code.

## A Database with a simple format

Every gazetteer record comes with the coverage area (bounding box),
administrative hierarchy, several identifiers,
alternative names and precalculated rank derived from related Wikipedia page popularity.

The TSV (tab separated value) data format simplifies handling of
the community curated data with over 21 million streets, towns,
cities and administrative units from every country all over the world.
Complete compressed dump has only about 1.5 gigabytes.

The dataset is optimized for indexing by fulltext search engines
(such as SphinxSearch or ElasticSearch) and can power a geocoding
service similar to the open-source Nominatim,
which served as a reference implementation,
especially regarding hierarchy of places, bbox and ranking.



#Place Search API

The OSMNames data set was optimized and tested to
feed the place search system of Klokan Technologies GmbH,
Switzerland, which allows to search for a geographic
location name and zoom a map to the right position.

The search system is available under an open-source license
and can be easily installed on a custom server completely free of charge.

Existing limits and future development
This initial release of OSMNames project provides only
place names for a basic search of street names, towns,
cities and other administrative units.

It can be extended in future with other place
types like lake or mountain names and even with POIs.

An enhancement with complete postal addresses
(house numbers and zip codes) is also possible but will need futher research.

Right now, the data is always pre-generated to simplify deployment and scalability.

The same fulltext search indexing system and ranking
could alsoe be used against a PostgreSQL with nearly live updates.
