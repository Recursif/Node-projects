Events:

app.on('mount', callback(parent))
The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function.


Router:

A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes.

You can think of it as a "mini-application", capable only of performing middleware and routing functions.

Every Express application has a built in app router.

A router behaves like middleware itself, so you can use it as an argument to app.use() or as the argument to another router's use()
router.

The top-level express object has a Router() method that creates a new router object.

Middleware tiers Express:

body-parser
cookie-session

morgan // precédement logger

passport // middleware dédié à l'authentification
